Note that all the file paths are only for my local device, and that there should exist empty directories title "Testing" and "Training" for the make_sets function to work.
In addition, there is currently no developed method for clearing the populated Testing and Training folders after each run of the file, so these must be manually deleted to ensure make_sets works.
